            <h2>Rock-Paper-Scissors game</h2>
            <div class="articleText">
                <p>I developed this simple, fun game with a fellow JavaScript student as a coding challenge to practice and reinforce our understanding of conditional statements in JavaScript.
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Collaboration:</strong> Working together allowed us to improve our teamwork skills and learn from each other's coding techniques.</li>
                    <li><strong>Interactive Fun:</strong> Rock-Paper-Scissors is a classic game that almost everyone knows, making it instantly accessible and enjoyable for players of all ages.</li>
                    <li><strong>Gotta Have Drama:</strong> We introduced setTimeouts into the game at key moments, making the player wait a second or so for their results to appear and for the game to reset. These timers create tension and hopefully make the player want to play again. I still play the game myself, to understand the code logic behind each victory or loss.</li>

                <h2>The Dungeon Master's Helper</h2>
                <p>I created a helpful browser-based interface using the D&D 5th Edition Public API. It includes the
                    following features:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Player's Handbook Visualization:</strong> A user-friendly interface that mimics the
                        layout and design of the Player's Handbook, making it easy for players and Dungeon Masters to
                        navigate.</li>
                    <li><strong>Interactive Search:</strong> Engaging and intuitive search options for finding monsters,
                        weapons, spells, and other game elements quickly and efficiently.</li>
                    <li><strong>Dynamic Content:</strong> Detailed information pages for each item, creature, and spell,
                        providing comprehensive and easily accessible game data.</li>
                    <li><strong>Custom Filters:</strong> Advanced filtering options to narrow down search results based
                        on specific criteria, enhancing the gameplay experience.</li>
