        <h2>About me:</h2>
        <p>As a seasoned illustrator, designer, and graphic artist transitioning into programming, I bring a unique blend of creativity and technical expertise to my work. With a certification in HTML/CSS and proficiency in JavaScript, I enhance website functionality and user experience. I am a dedicated problem-solver, constantly seeking new knowledge, experiences, and challenges. My interests span sci-fi and fantasy, history, and the mechanics of how things work. I thrive in collaborative team environments, where I contribute enthusiastically to bring ideas to life, and I also cherish the quiet, focused hours working alone in my studio. My easy-going nature balances my intense drive to hunt down solutions, making me a versatile and passionate professional.</p>
        <p>My next steps: I am fascinated by how code can create visual art so I plan to study SVG code and the D3 JavaScript library.</p>
