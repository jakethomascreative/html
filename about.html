        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>As a seasoned illustrator, designer, and graphic artist transitioning into programming, I bring a unique blend of creativity and technical expertise to my work. My experience in graphics production enables me to approach a project with both a detail-oriented eye as well as a holistic mind. As a visually impaired person I am passionate about the experience of all users, especially those affected by physical limitations.</p>
        <h4>Personality</h4>
        <p>I am a dedicated problem-solver, constantly seeking new knowledge, experiences, and challenges. I thrive in collaborative team environments where I can join with my fellow creatives to bring ideas to life but I do cherish the quiet, focused hours working solo in my studio. My easy-going nature balances my intense drive to hunt down solutions, making me a versatile and passionate professional as well as a valuable collaborator.</p>
        <h4>I like...</h4>
        <p>My imagination is ignited by sci-fi and fantasy, history, and the mechanics of how things work. The sublime nature of music and storytelling reach and captivate me in ways I cannot describe. I love dogs and I am fascinated by the human connection to animals, to each other, and to our planet.</p>
        <h4>Professional focus:</h4>
        <p>I recognize the critical importance of accessibility in apps and on the web and I plan to keep this focus in my work. I am studying the D3 JavaScript library, and the code behind SVG files, as I am fascinated by how code can create art.</p>
